# 2 what is a real free hosting and scam project 

**official free hosting**

real hosing is working like ads to get monney mistake to maintain their server it is called win to win both sides benefit user get a free server and server provider get a profit to maintain

The most popular are aternos, magnanode,atexx cloud,slicehosting and northvm 

This type of hosting is usually long term and users will be limited by server hardware and some inconveniences but it is still ok.

Normally these providers do not need to mine coins in the system or refresh because they have added ads to their website but there are still some providers who still have ways to earn coins in the system so users can buy more resources like ram, cpu, disk etc.
