hi iam mrbeeenopro and today i tell you what is a real hosting and other scam like summer hosting joke hosting...



# 1first what is a free hosting

free hosting is a free server to hosting game or software hosting like nodejs python bun...
but i see 80% free hosting is a game hosting
is a Minecraft and hosting

# 2 what is a real free hosting and scam project 

**official free hosting**

real hosing is working like ads to get monney mistake to maintain their server it is called win to win both sides benefit user get a free server and server provider get a profit to maintain

The most popular are aternos, magnanode,atexx cloud,slicehosting and northvm 

This type of hosting is usually long term and users will be limited by server hardware and some inconveniences but it is still ok.

Normally these providers do not need to mine coins in the system or refresh because they have added ads to their website but there are still some providers who still have ways to earn coins in the system so users can buy more resources like ram, cpu, disk etc.

**joke,90day hosting**
These servers are usually 100% free at first. 
Allows users full access to the server usually these servers are ad free and use coins to renew the server upgrade resources etc.

These free servers often use free virtual desktop services like

**aws(Amazon web service)**

**digital ocean (free 200$ use in 3 month)**

**Microsoft azure (free 1 month)**

and many other suppliers that I can't name.

These servers are usually open for 1-3 months and there will be 3 cases

1 well the server will save all user data and close the server maybe they will reopen it in some time

2 These servers will either become pay to play servers or will sell the servers or delete everything and no data or information will be saved.

3 bad ending will all info or hosting will nuke and gone neverr comback 

Usually servers will fall into case 2 and 3 but not all here is the list I know

*minet(closed hosting game)

*complix(closed)

*sppohosting (by spigot unlocked closed 2023)

*z cloud *

*beecloud (my free hosting and i closed in 2025

*qyro hosting woring but tps like shit

**scam,summerhost**

These servers are similar to 90 days hosting but it has ads like real hosting and donations for sure

These projects are usually created to make money from user donations and they will abandon the project after 3 to 4 months maybe 1 month

# Be careful when using free hosting services
